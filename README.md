# About

This project aims to conduct some experiments with clustering tweet. There are three approaches, the first using Doc2vec, the second is using tf-idf and the last is using Word2vec.

# Instructions to Run the first approach (Doc2vec)

- First execute: `$ sh 1_script_dataCleanup.sh`
- Second, execute: `$ sh 2_script_run.sh`
- At the end, it will create a file on "data_out" folder with the clustering performed 

# Instructions to Run the second approach (TF-IDF)

- First execute: `$python tf_idf.py`


# Instructions to Run the third approach (Word2vec)

- First execute: `$python word2vec.py`
